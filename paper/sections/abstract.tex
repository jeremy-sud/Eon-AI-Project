\begin{abstract}
Modern Artificial Intelligence has become synonymous with massive computational resources, relying on large-scale backpropagation and GPU clusters. This trend excludes a vast ecosystem of ultra-low power devices (microcontrollers, IoT sensors) from participating in the "intelligence" revolution. In this work, we present \textbf{Eón}, a minimalist machine learning framework based on Echo State Networks (ESNs) designed explicitly for constrained environments ($<$2KB RAM). We propose a novel "Spirit Hash" mechanism for deterministic reservoir initialization across platforms and a 1-Bit Weight Quantization protocol for effective Peer-to-Peer synchronization. We demonstrate Eón's capabilities through three prototypes: (1) \textit{TinyLM}, a language model utilizing trie-compressed vocabularies; (2) \textit{Eón Bio}, a privacy-preserving cardiac arrhythmia detector running on a 1.3KB RAM core; and (3) \textit{Eón Voice}, a keyword spotting engine for Cortex-M4. Our results show that computationally "poor" devices can exhibit rich temporal processing capabilities without cloud dependency.
