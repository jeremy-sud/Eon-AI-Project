\section{Conclusion}

Eón demonstrates that useful intelligence does not strictly require massive scale. By carefully optimizing the "software of the mind"---specifically, by leveraging the mathematical properties of Reservoir Computing and deterministic generation---we can embed adaptive learning into the smallest of electronic devices. This opens the door to a "Mycelial Intelligence" where smart dust, bio-implants, and environmental sensors can learn, adapt, and share knowledge without ever touching the cloud.
